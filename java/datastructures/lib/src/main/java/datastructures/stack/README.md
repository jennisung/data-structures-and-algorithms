# Code Challenge: Class 10: Stack and a Queue Implementation
### Stack
* Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
* This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
* The class should contain the following methods:
push
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
* pop
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
Removes the node from the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
* peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
* is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
