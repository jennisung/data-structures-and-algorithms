# Code Challenge: Class 10: Stack and a Queue Implementation
### Queue
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
dequeue
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
Removes the node from the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty queue
peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty
